# nx-ngx-bs

Angular utilities and components featuring rxjs, ngrx, and bootstrap

## ngx-observable-components
- [lifecycle-decorators](./lifecycle-decorators.md) - expose component lifecycle events as rxjs events instead of function hooks
- [props](./props.md) - manage `@Input`s as a single observable stream, without the need for `ngOnChanges`
- [[actions]] - expose component `@Output`s as an event stream, just like DOM elements
